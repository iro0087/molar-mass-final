# molar-mass-final
Calculate the molar mass of every molecules (chemical complex, polymers, normal...).
The data of each atom molar mass is precise to 0.1
The file is zip because can't find the source code (i switched os and only the zip was saved on my nas).
But working on a much bigger project coming soon that has this source code modified between others from projects.
